# UnityGameEncryptionPuzzleLevel

This is a simple Uniy based project with just one level. 
The level is about an AgentX who is solving an encrypted cypher to get the co-ordinates to his goal..
The remaining levels are being made by Mostafa All, Mohammed Alaa Shedo, Ahmed Ayman, Zeyad el-3assal and Mohammed Khalifa.
there's no current plan to add those levels here in the mean time.
